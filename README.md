# MusicSeer

Forked from the Raycast **Genius Lyrics** extension: [raycast/extensions/tree/main/extensions/genius-lyrics](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/tree/main/extensions/genius-lyrics).

MusicSeer helps you find and work with song lyrics from Genius. You can search by title, search by remembered lyric lines, auto-search using the track currently playing on macOS, and open source pages on Genius.com. It also includes AI lyric interpretation with a prompt management interface so you can customize how interpretations are generated.

On macOS, `Search Lyrics by Title` now auto-detects the currently playing (or recently paused) track using `media-control` when no query is provided. Install it with `brew install media-control`.
